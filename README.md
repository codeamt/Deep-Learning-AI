## About the Specialization
Far from a topical overview, [Andrew Ng](https://medium.com/@andrewng)'s [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) is a five-part series of courses exploring foundational concepts of Deep Learning. 

Using Matrix Algebra, Linear Calculus, and Python as the programming language of choice, students take black box approaches to implement Neural Networks - from forward passing and back propagation within a simple deep net to more complex architectures and Bayesian methods for calculating weights and improving accuracy. Moreover, the specialization guides thought in building intuitions about hyper-parameter tuning, decision making for future employers and academic research projects, and diffuses the potential career paths for this emerging space in tech through guest interviews with thought leaders in the space.

In later parts of the specialization, Ng requires students to implement well-known algorithms (Jupyter notebooks for each course, linked below) from scientific papers; providing a platform to continue on with/lead research and DL projects.
