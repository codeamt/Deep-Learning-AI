<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

In the [fourth installment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) of deeplearning.ai, Andrew Ng introduces a new class of Deep Learning architectures - the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and how to apply CNNs on unstructured data (in this case, image data).

The most prevelant use case for the CNN architecture is <i>Computer Vision</i>; an area of deep learning that has broken ground in just a couple of years. Examples of Computer Vision include: 

- Autonomous Driving 
- Facial Recognition 
- Automatic Reading of Radiology Images 
- Neural Style Transfer 

Up until this point in the course, examples have explored Image Classification with a basic, fully connected neural network architecture. Professor Ng demonstrates how a 1000x1000 color image inputed into a hidden layer with 1000 neurons can quickly become an infeasable training task for a simple NN.

Instead, best practice is to use the <b><i>Convolution Operation</i></b> on an image - that is, layering a filter matrix (each place in the matrix representing a certain integer value) on top of the training image (starting from the upper most-left corner) and summing the element-wise products of filter pixels and image pixels:
