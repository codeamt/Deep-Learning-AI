<b>Goal:</b> Implement the [YOLOv2 model](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/) to build an object detection algorithm for a self-driving car that is capable of recognizing 80 classes. 

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.
- [x] Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
- [x] Get a better sense of how transfer learning works in practice.
