<b>Goal:</b> Implement convolutional and pooling layer from scratch with Numpy. At least implement forward propagation, and optionally attempt to implement back prop. 

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Understand the building blocks of a CNN architecture
- [x] Gain deeper insights about how CNNs work 
- [x] Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
