<b>Goal:</b> Implement the VGG-19 Network architecture from the research paper <i>A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</i> by Gatys et al., and generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (Content Image), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (Style Image).

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn how to use Neural Style Transfer to generate artistic images
- [x] Understand why updating the total cost function results in synthesizing new images.
