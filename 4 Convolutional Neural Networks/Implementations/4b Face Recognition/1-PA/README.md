<b>Goal:</b> Implement the Inception model from the research papers <i>Going Deeper with Convolutions</i> by Szegedy et al., and <i>FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering</i> by Schroff et al. 

Build/improve the facial recognition and verification algorithm we implemented for the Happy House in an earlier lesson.  

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn how to implement the triplet loss function
- [x] Understand how to use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings.
- [x] Understand how to use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition
