<b>Goal:</b> Build a facial recognition algorithm that opens the door to the "Happy House" only if the guest is happy. 

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK.
- [x] See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.
