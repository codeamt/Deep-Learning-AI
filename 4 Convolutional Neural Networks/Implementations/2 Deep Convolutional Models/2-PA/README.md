<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
- [x] Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
- [x] Get a better sense of how to fix the vanishing gradient issue in CNNs with skip connections.
