<h1 align="center">Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step</h1>

<b>Goal:</b>
<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b>

- [x] Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
- [x] Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
- [x] Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
