<b>Goal:Build a deep Neural Network that classifies cats.</b>

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.
- [x] Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
- [x] Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
