<b>Goal: Use a Neural Network to classify points on a (flower) plot.</b>

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
- [x] Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
- [x] Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
