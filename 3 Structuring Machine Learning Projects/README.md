<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

Midway through the specialization, the [third course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects) slows things down a bit (taking a break from programming assignments) and serves as the bottleneck before exposure to some of the more advanced model architectures deep learning has to offer. You could easily take this course by its lonesome. In fact, Professor Ng recently [dropped a book](http://www.mlyearning.org/), entitled <i>Machine Learning Yearning</i>, derived from the material taught here. 

Some of the skills learnt to help construct Machine Learning strategy, specifically for deep learning, include:

- Learning how orthogonilization - that is, a clear understanding of the cause and effect between specific hyperparameters and certain outcomes - can be used to improve precision with very few adjustments 
- How to evalute various classifiers against each other based on a single number evaluation metric (e.g., F1 score and/or performance average)
- Deciding on satisficing and optimizing metrics, trade-offs between the two, and when to use this approach verses a single number evaluation metric
- Intuitions and considerations about determining train/dev/test set distributions (e.g., to avoid transposing human bias) to best serve target end users of an application 
- When (natural data tasks) to compare NN's performance to Bayes error, and next steps if projects perform worse than humans
- When to sub Human-level error as a proxy for Bayes error and train to perform better than that baseline goal
- Exploring nuances of human-level error (exemplified through a medical imaging example with 4 types human evaluators)
- Identifying when DL might surpass human performance (e.g., problems that do not rely on natural perception, big data, etc.)
- Performing error analysis and data pre-processing techniques  
- Understanding when to use end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning (e.g., for rapid prototyping for improvement vs. completely new model)
- More!

One of the more exciting courses in this series, Andrew Ng pulls from his own personal experience with building and shipping DL projects to design "flight simulators" that prep you for a career in AI as a technical lead by building intuitions about scenarios one would likely encounter through years of "industry experience". (Thank you!)
