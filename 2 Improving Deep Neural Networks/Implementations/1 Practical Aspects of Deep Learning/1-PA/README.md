<b>Goal:</b> Initialize weights appropriately to build a classifier that can determine a barrier for points on a plot.

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.
- [x] Implement dropout and see it work on data.
- [x] Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.
- [x] Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
