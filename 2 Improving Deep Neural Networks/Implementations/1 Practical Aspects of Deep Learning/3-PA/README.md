<b>Goal:</b> Ensure that the back propagation algorithm in your network is working properly. 

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Implement gradient checking from scratch.
- [x] Understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation.
- [x] Recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula.
- [x] Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
