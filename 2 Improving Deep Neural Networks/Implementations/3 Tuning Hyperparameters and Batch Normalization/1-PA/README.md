<b>Goal:</b> Use the Tensorflow framework to build an image classifier for sign language. 

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Implement useful functions and draw the parallel with what you did using Numpy
- [x] Understand how to execute tensors on a computational graph
- [x] Understand how to implement your own deep learning models using Tensorflow
