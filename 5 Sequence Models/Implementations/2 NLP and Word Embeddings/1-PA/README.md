<b>Goal:</b> Practice modifying word embeddings to reduce their gender bias and in the process explore concepts from the research paper <i>Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings</i> by [Bolukbasi et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf)(2016) and for word embeddings, the project <i>GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation</i> by [Manning et al](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn how to load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity
- [x] Understand how to use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.
