<b>Goal:</b> Generate your own jazz music with deep learning. Implementations abstracted from the computational music project <i>deepjazz</i> by [Ji-Sung Kim](https://github.com/jisungk/deepjazz)(2016) and research papers <i>Learning Jazz Grammars</i> by [Gillick et al.](http://ai.stanford.edu/~kdtang/papers/smc09-jazzgrammar.pdf)(2009), <i>A Grammatical Approach to
Automatic Improvisation</i> by [Keller and Morrison](http://smc07.uoa.gr/SMC07%20Proceedings/SMC07%20Paper%2055.pdf)(2007), and <i>Surprising Harmonies </i> by [Fran√ßois Pachet](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.5.7473&rep=rep1&type=pdf)(1999)

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Learn how to apply an LSTM to music generation/more about sampling.
- [x] Learn how to post-process musical values to midi music
- [x] Learn nuances about implementing LSTMs with the Keras library
