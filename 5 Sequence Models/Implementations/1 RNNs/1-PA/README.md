<b>Goal:</b> Implement a simple RNN, the LSTM cell, and LSTM network (with forward prop and optionally, back prop) from scratch with Numpy. 

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] Better understand how RNNs and LSTM units work.
- [x] Understand how weight initialization works with RNNs
