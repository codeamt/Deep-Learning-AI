<b>Goal:</b> Build a character-level language model to generate new dinosaur names. Then, optionally, use LSTM cells to learn Shakespeare's writing style and generate a new poem.

<b>Andrew Ng's Learning Objectives:</b> 

- [x] How to store text data for processing using an RNN
- [x] How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit
- [x] How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network
- [x] Learn why clipping the gradients is important
